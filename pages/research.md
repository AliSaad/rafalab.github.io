The unprecedented advancements in digital technology during the second half
of the 20th century has produced a measurement revolution that is
transforming science. In biomedical research, the Genomics revolution
is being driven by new technologies that permit us to observe
molecular entities analogous to identifying microorganisms and other
breakthroughs permitted by the invention of the microscope.
Choice examples of these technologies are next
generation sequencing (NGS) and microarrays.

Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data
analysis techniques have been turned on their heads by these
technologies. Interpreting information extracted from these
massive and complex datasets requires sophisticated statistical
methodology as one can easily be fooled by patterns arising by chance
or systematic errors that are hard to detect. 

Rafael Irizarry's lab is interested in the development of
statistical tools that help researchers better interpret their
data. The lab disseminates these tools through open source that is available 
for free online. This software has tens of
thousands of users and the scientific publications in which these
methods are highly cited.

## Current Projects

Current projects can be dividing into the following:

- Accounting for systematic errors in transcript quantification with RNA-Seq.
- Tackling batch effects in single-cell RNA-Seq.
- Tackling batch effects in microbiome data.
- Accounting for systematic error in ChIP-Seq data to improve peak.
  detection and differential abundance analysis.
- Detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with 
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.
- Creating a transcript expression barcode using RNA-Seq Data.
- Developing [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org)
infrastructure and packages.

## Joining the Lab

If you are graduating soon with a PhD in Statistics, Biostatistics or Computer
Science and are interested in the topics listed above, consider applying to join
the lab as a postdoc. If you are a graduate student at Harvard you should consider
doing a rotation. We don't always have positions available but contacting us is
the most common way that current members have joined the lab.

To succeed in our lab you need to have vast experience in data
analysis and strong programming skills (we prefer R). Although Professor
Irizarry makes time to meet each trainee weekly and the lab is highly
collaborative, group members are expected to be independent.
