## Data Science

We teach an [introductory
data science class](<a href="http://datasciencelabs.github.io/">) at the Harvard School of Public Health. 

We also have developed several online courses on data analysis that are offered by HarvardX which have been completed by thousands of studnets. These courses are divided into two series: [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences) and [Genomics Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/xseries/genomics-data-analysis). Much of the material is included in a [book](https://amzn.com/1498775675) with a [online version](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) available for free.
