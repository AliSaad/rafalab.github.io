            <h2>Rafael A Irizarry's Biographical Sketch<br>
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Dr. Irizarry received his bachelor’s in mathematics in
              1993 from the University of Puerto Rico and went on to
              receive a Ph.D. in statistics in 1998 from the University
              of California, Berkeley. His thesis work was on
              Statistical Models for Music Sound Signals. He joined the
              faculty of the Department of Biostatistics in the Johns
              Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 1998 and was
              promoted to Professor in 2007. He is now Professor of
              Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the Dana Farber
              Cancer Center and a Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard
              School of Public Health. For the past fourteen years, Dr.
              Irizarry’s work has focused on Genomics and Computational
              Biology problems. In particular, he has worked on the
              analysis and signal processing of microarray,
              next-generation sequencing, and genomic data. He is
              currently interested in leveraging his knowledge in
              translational work, e.g. developing diagnostic tools and
              discovering biomarkers.</p>
            <p>Dr. Irizarry also develops open source software
              implementing his statistical methodology. His software
              tools are widely used and he is one of the leaders and
              founders of the Bioconductor Project, an open source and
              open development software project for the analysis of
              genomic data. Bioconductor provides the most widely used
              software tool for the analysis of microarray data.</p>
            <p>In 2009, the Committee of Presidents of Statistical
              Societies (COPSS) named Dr. Irizarry the Presidents' Award
              winner. The Presidents' Award is arguably the profession's
              most prestigious award honoring early career
              contributions. Dr. Irizarry also received the 2009
              Mortimer Spiegelman Award which honors an outstanding
              public health statistician under age 40. He also won the
              2001 American Statistical Association Noether Young
              Scholar Award for researcher, younger than 35 years of
              age, who has significant research accomplishments in
              nonparametrics statistics. Dr Irizarry was also named a
              fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2009.</p>
            <p>Three of Dr. Irizarry’s numerous publications have been
              named Fast Breaking Paper, New Hot Paper, or Current
              Classic Paper in Mathematics by Thomson Essential Science
              Indicators (ESI). According to the ESI’s Scientist
              Rankings, he is one of the most highly cited researchers
              in Mathematics and Computer Science. One of his
              publications won the 2004 American Statistical Association
              (ASA) Outstanding Statistical Application Award. He was
              awarded the ASA Youden Award in Interlaboratory Testing
              for another of his publications. Dr. Irizarry co-edited
              Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions using R
              and Bioconductor (Springer 2005), which has been
              translated to Chinese and Japanese.</p>
